This is the form section. This form is used for users to submit an application to become a contributor and provide their user data.

##### 6. Footer

In summary, footers on websites offer practical benefits such as easy navigation, contact information, and additional resources, while also supporting branding consistency, legal compliance, and mobile responsiveness. A well-designed footer enhances the user experience and adds value to the overall website.

## Brancing

GitHub branching refers to the practice of creating separate lines of development within a Git repository. It allows multiple developers to work on different features or make changes to a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.

In GitHub, branching involves creating a new branch that branches off from the main codebase (usually called the "master" or "main" branch). Each branch represents a specific set of changes or feature being worked on. Developers can switch between branches to work on different tasks independently.

This Repo contains:

## Deployment

Web deployment refers to the process of making a website or web application available and accessible to users on the internet. It involves taking the web development project and making it live on a web server, allowing people to access and interact with the website through their web browsers. I use Netlify for deployment. Here are the steps for deploying using Netlify:

##### 1. Open Netlify
